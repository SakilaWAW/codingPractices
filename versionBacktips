#There is something tips in git version back.

#When you want to reset the change you have down.
#There are FOUR situations.
#1.I didn't call "git add" yet.
#In this situation,you can call "git checkout -- fileName" to reset the changes.

#2.I have called "git add",but no "git commit" yet.
#In this situation,you can call "git reset HEAD fileName" to reset the changes in stages.
#Then you should repeat the situation 1 to reset the changes in you workspace.

#3.Oh my god.I have called "git commit"!
#Don't worry.As long as you didn't sync your local repository to the remote repository,
#it will be OK.Just call "git reset --hard HEAD^" will reset the changes in repository,
#in your workspace and also in your stage.

#4.Do I still have chance if I have sync the repository?
#No,you have no chance.
